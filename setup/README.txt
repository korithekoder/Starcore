If you are a new developer, or if you forked/cloned the game from GitHub, then 
please follow these steps to make the game runnable!!

1. Install the latest version of Haxe from the official website (4.3.6 is recommended!)
Official Haxe Installation Page (for 4.3.6) -> https://haxe.org/download/version/4.3.6/

2. Run the libraries setup file (depending on what platform you are on), located in the same folder 
you are reading this ".txt" file from. This will install all of the required libraries you need to code the game!

3. When you are done installing everything, select the Lime config target you want
(Desktop highly recommended) and the game should launch!
