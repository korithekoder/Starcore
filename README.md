# NOTICE: THIS GAME IS A HEAVY WIP
Due to how complex this game (will) be, it will be quite some time
before even a basic demo will come out.

When one *does* come out, ***WAY*** more info will be put in here and it
will be released on [itch.io](https://itch.io) under my name (`@korithekoder`), so
when it does release, be sure to take a look!

# Development

When developing the game, it is ***strongly*** advised that you play in debug mode, that
way, multiple tools can be provided for you, such as built-in editors, tools to manipulate
entities and planets, and much more!

To access them, simply select the option for your platform (in the example shown it's windows)
and make sure it has `/ Debug` at the end!
